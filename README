Charlie.vim
===

A vim plugin for cutting lines.


What?
---
Charlie.vim lets you split a line at the current cursor position.

How?
---
Pathogen blah blah

By default it uses `K` (going nicely with `J` for join, but you can remap it:
`let g:charlie_split_here_key = 'K'`


Why?
---
Because typing `i<Enter><Esc>` or `r<Enter>` (depending on whitespace) is too
much work and I wanted to see how vim plugins worked.
